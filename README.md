## Setup a new mac

1. Install command line tools

   ```sh
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. Insert Smart Card (Yubikey, Ledger, etc.)

3. Install Homebrew, GPG, Chezmoi and launch configuration

   ```sh
   # Install Homebrew
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   [[ $(arch) == "arm64" ]] && eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)" || eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"

   # Install GPG and Chezmoi
   brew install gpg chezmoi

   # Use configuration from this repo
   chezmoi init politician --apply
   ```

4. My personal todo list of manual actions:

   - [ ] This script will open, Alfred, Moom, Docker Desktop. You must manually grant them the needed permissions and enable start at boot
   - [ ] Grant Full disk access to Alfred and Terminal
   - [ ] Reboot `sudo shutdown -r now`
   - [ ] Connect to Firefox sync or copy profile folder (open _about:profiles_)
   - [ ] Install Xcode `mas install 497799835` (was removed from this script because the 12GB+ download can be slow as hell)

### Before formatting a mac

Make sure all files are up to date with chezmoi

cd ~

# Export list of brew/cask/mas installed packages
brew bundle dump --force

# Re-add linked files
chezmoi re-add

# Re-add VSCode settings as multi-arch template
sed 's|'"$(brew --prefix)"'|{{ if eq .chezmoi.arch "arm64" }}/opt/homebrew{{ else }}/usr/local{{ end }}|' ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json > $(chezmoi source-path)/private_Library/private_Application\ Support/private_Code/User/settings.json.tmpl
```

## Applications

This repo includes scripts to
[install](run_once_before_3-install-packages-darwin.sh.tmpl) as well as
[build](run_once_before_5-build-apps-darwin.sh.tmpl) all the apps that need to be.

I try to choose OSS apps over commercial ones unless the experience is too degraded or it prevents me from doing my work properly.

Here are the most notable ones:
